    content: '`HEARTBEAT.md` is checked every 30 minutes. You can manage periodic
      tasks by editing this file:


      - **Add a task**: Use `edit_file` to append new tasks to `HEARTBEAT.md`

      - **Remove a task**: Use `edit_file` to remove completed or obsolete tasks

      - **Rewrite tasks**: Use `write_file` to completely rewrite the task list


      Task format examples:



      When the user asks you to add a recurring/periodic task, update `HEARTBEAT.md`
      instead of creating a one-time reminder. Keep the file small to minimize token
      usage.'
